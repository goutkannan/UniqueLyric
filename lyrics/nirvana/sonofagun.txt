Up up up and down
Turn turn turnaround
Round round roundabout
And over again
Gun gun son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference what I say

[x2]
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away

Up up up and down
Turn turn turnaround
Round round roundabout
And over again
Gun gun son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference what I say

[x2]
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away

Up up up and down
Turn turn turnaround
Round round roundabout
And over again
Gun gun son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference what I say

[x4]
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
