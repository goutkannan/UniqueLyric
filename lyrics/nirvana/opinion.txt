Congratulations you have won
It's a years subscription of bad puns.
And it makes your story our concern
And you set it up for returns (Alt: You said it all and you glory burns)

Your state of emotion seems to clear.
You rise and fall like wall street stock
And you had an affect on our happy talk.

Our opinions. Mmm. Mmm. [x2]
