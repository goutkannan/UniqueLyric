If it's a hard, cold beat
You can go dance every night
You won't get it shown
It won't be missing the spice
You won't know that it hit ya

Nothing'll make you win
Even the law won't fight
Yeah!

Looking to make your winning
Even if it makes you look nice
You got a sound that's nice
Watching the days go by
You can't go to the day lord's house
We don't have no doubt
We go to too many cocktails
Pimples in way..
