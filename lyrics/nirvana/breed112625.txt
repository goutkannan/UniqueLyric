I don't care [x2]
Care, care, care, care if I'm old 
I don't mind [x3]
Mind, mind, don't have a mind 
Get away [x2]
Away, away, away, away from your home 
I don't mind [x2]
Mind, mind, mind ...

Even if you have 
Even if you need 
I don't even care
We could have a tree
We could plant a house
We could build a tree
I don't even care 
We could have a tree
