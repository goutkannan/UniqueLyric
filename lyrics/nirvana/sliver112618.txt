Mom and dad went to a show
Dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
Kicked and screamed, said please, don't go

Grandma take me home [x7]
Wanna be alone

Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatos and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

Grandma take me home [x7]
Wanna be alone

Said, why don't you stop your crying
Go outside and ride your bike
That's what I did, I killed my toe

Grandma take me home [x7]
Wanna be alone

After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep, and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms

Grandma take me home [x16]
Never take me home [x2]
Grandma take me home

Wanna be alone
