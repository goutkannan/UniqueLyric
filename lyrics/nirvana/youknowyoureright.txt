I would never bother you
I would never promise to
I would never follow you
I would never bother you

Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good

I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear

No thought was put into this
Always knew it would come to this

Things have never been so swell
I have never felt this well

(alt:
I have never felt so frail/
I have never failed to feel/
I have never felt to feel/
I have never failed to fail)

Pain! [x3]
You know you're right [x3]

I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide

Let's talk about someone else
Sterling silver begins to melt

(alt:
Steaming soup against her mouth/
Steaming soup begins to melt)

Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love herself

I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear

No thought was put into this
Always knew it would come to this

Things have never been so swell
I have never felt this well

(alt:
I have never felt so frail/
I have never failed to feel/
I have never felt to feel/
I have never failed to fail)

Pain! [x5]
You know you're right [x17]

Pain ...
