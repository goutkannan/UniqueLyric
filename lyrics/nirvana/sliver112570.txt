Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please, don't go

Grandma take me home [x8]

Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatos and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

Never take me home [x8] (Alt: Grandma take me home [x8])

She said, well, don't you start your crying
(Alt: Said, why don't you stop your crying)

Go outside and ride your bike
Thats what I did, I killed my toad

Never take me home [x8]

After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep, and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms

Never take me home [x19]
I wanna be alone
