Goodbye my friend its hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
And all the flowers are everywhere
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

Goodbye Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
And I don't know all these words
I had boggy turds
With my b.b. gun I would kill birds

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

All our lives, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the world that we reached
Were just starfish on the beach

Goodbye Michelle, my little one
I was the apple of the shining sun
Another apple out of reach
All my tears are salty
I think now I was taught to weep

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
All the hills that we climb
Were the seasons out of time

We had joy. We had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hill on the beach
Were just starfish on the beach

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climb
Were just seasons out of time

Ah the joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars that we reached
Were just starfish on the beach
