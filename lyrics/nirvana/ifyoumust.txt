I can read, I can write
I can breed, proven plight
Nurse my greed, crease infold
Is it me, or my ego?

Write some words, make them rhyme
Thesis or story line
Set the mood, something new
Is it me, or my attitude?

She said
If you want to put off an image
And you miss, the extremes
The extremes, act it out
Practicing
Perfecting
Pressuring
Onto me [x3]

I will wade, in the fire
To explain, your asylum
Idle times, analyzing
We'll compare, all our sightings, come on

I speak, to hear, my voice
