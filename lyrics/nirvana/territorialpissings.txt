"Come on people now, smile on your brother and
everybody get together, try to love one another right now"

When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way - a better way - I had better wait

[x2]
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way - a better way - I had better wait

"Just because you're paranoid, don't mean they're not after you"

[x4]
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way - a better way - I had better wait
