Why doesn't she need him for a father?
Not only maidens can occupy my shack
Goring my manhood turns a man off
Like Pepe LePew would say, 
Hey, hey, hey! -- and then we clash!

I got my diddly spayed [x3]
I got my diddly

She laughs about it
Shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right
Jacking themselves off polyester
I wanna jump, this isn't right! 
Hey, when am I getting it back?

I got my diddly spayed [x3]
I got my diddly

I don't know why,
I've got a joke too silly to say
Don't touch the balls
I got a dick, Dick -- hear my fucking hate!

I got my diddly spayed [x3]
I got my diddly

If you're wondering, it's gaining monthly
Fiberglass insulated, the sky is cotton candy
Spawning downstream, El Rancho Ovulate
Feeling can't help me romp

Bill just fuck me, take me anal
Billy's slit reminds me of someone
I'm sick of paying for the love boat
Tony and Tenille say wanna jump rope
And I say look!

I got my penis spayed, 
I got a little tail,
I got my dingaling spayed
I got my dingaling spayed
I gotta be around pussy
Don't let me fall
I got a heh-heh ... well you can't live

We got my dingaling spayed [x6]
I got my dingaling spayed [x5]
I got my diddly
