If I may
If I might
lay me down weeping

If I say
What it's like
I might be dreaming

If I may
What is right
Summer time, see me heal

Those years in his blond head
The phrase from his pocket
Chains from the knowing lifelong dream

Do re mi
Don't rape me
Do re mi
Don't Rape me

If I may
If I might
wake me up, see me

If I do
If I like
Find me out, to see me

If I'm made
Cold as ice
I may have to see me heal

Raised in his own care
erased from his women
And chains from his socket I will need

Re mi
Re mi
Do re mi
Don't rape me
Do re mi
Don't rape me

wish me good
Wish me life
Find me out of season

In their way
Just be quiet
Follow pain and breed me

Yell r well
And if I sigh
Stake me out the TV

If I may
And if I might
Got a gun to bleed me

Raised in his pocket
erased from this moment
And chains from his owner in my tea

Re Mi
Re Mi
Re Mi
cremate me
Do re mi
Don't rape me
Do re mi
