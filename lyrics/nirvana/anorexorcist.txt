Look your legs are ashes
Charred into a special
Don't make noise you'll break
Your legs, your eyes and all
You're right

I was your incompetent
Man just read the furies
Special time but you can't
Make too much of him
Gray
Oh, oh

I was yours and closer
You were them in New York
Got me in to entertain
Your legs are in your legs

I was your end dancer
More than all I wish you
Got me under with the
Nice, nice, nice religious man
Oh, Oh...
