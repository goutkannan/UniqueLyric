Mayday every day, in my heart.
Could've had a heart attack, in my heart.
We don't know anything, in my heart.
We all want something fair, in my heart.
Hey!
Hey!
Heyyyyyyy! [x3]

Out of town, out of sight, is my heart.
Queen of lies, everyday, in my heart.
My heart, one more on the phone, my heart.
One more at the phone, at my heart
Hey!
Hey!
Heyyyyyyyyyyy! [x2]

Mean heart, cold heart, cold heart, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart, cold heart, cold heart!

Uhhhhhhh!
