Thank you for your patience!

If you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
If you wouldn't care I would like to blew
If you wouldn't mind I would like to leave
If you wouldn't care I would like to breathe

Is there another reason for your stain
Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame

If you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
If you wouldn't care I would like to blew
If you wouldn't mind I would like to leave
If you wouldn't care I would like to breathe
