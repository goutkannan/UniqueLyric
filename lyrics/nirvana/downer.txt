Portray sincerity
Act out of loyalty
Defend every country
Wish away the pain

Make enough of the words as you go along, I sing then some

Sickening pessimist hypocrite master
Conservative Communist apocalyptic bastard

I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst!

Hold me down in restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is the whole fleece shun in master?
Don't feel guilty, master writing

Somebody said that they're not much like I am, I know I can
Make enough of the words as you go along, I sing then some
