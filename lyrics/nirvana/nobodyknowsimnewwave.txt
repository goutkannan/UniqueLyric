Sure I can shit anywhere,
and I promise you here I will shit on this stage and I'll,
crawl in it, sound in it, falling down and I...
I choose to shit anywhere,
and I promise to shit on your head if you want,
I have a God and a father to flounder and follow my life anywhere 
and always I will do what I need.
God I'm shit,
I'll shit anywhere,
and now I choose to shit on your face and I'm, right
and God, oh God, oh wife
why the hell am I not safe.
I'm new wave, I'm new wave, I'm new wave.
I'm new wave, I'm new wave, I'm new wave,
I'm old school, I'm old school,
I'm new wave, I'm a threat,
I'm a wave, I'm away,
I am wave and I shit anywhere that I please.
