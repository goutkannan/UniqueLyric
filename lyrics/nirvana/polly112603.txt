Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

Isn't me,
Have some seed
Let me clip,
Dirty wings
Let me take a ride,
Hurt yourself
Want some help,
Help myself
Got some rope,
Have been told
Promise you,
Have been true
Let me take a ride,
Hurt yourself
Want some help,
Help myself

Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like more food
She asks me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

Isn't me,
Have some seed
Let me clip,
Dirty wings
Let me take a ride,
Hurt yourself
Want some help,
Help myself
Got some rope,
Have been told
Promise you,
Have been true
Let me take a ride,
Hurt yourself
Want some help,
Help myself

Polly said

Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
It amazes me, the will of instinct

Isn't me,
Have some seed
Let me clip,
Dirty wings
Let me take a ride,
Hurt yourself
Want some help,
Help myself
Got some rope,
Have been told
Promise you,
Have been true
Let me take a ride,
Hurt yourself
Want some help,
Help myself
