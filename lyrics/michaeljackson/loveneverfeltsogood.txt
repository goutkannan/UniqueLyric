Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it's never mine,
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the nights gonna be just fine,
Gotta fly, gotta see, got to be
I can't take it,

'Cause, baby, every time I love you, in and out of my life, in out, baby,
Tell me, if you really love me it's in and out my life, in out, baby
So, baby, yes, love never felt so good.

Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could,
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night through the thick and thin
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, 'cause

Baby, every time I love you, it's in and out my life, in out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me, it's in and out my life driving me crazy
Baby, love never felt so good

And I'd die if you never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
And I'd die if it ever could, not like you hold me, hold me

Aww, baby, love never felt so fine,
And I'd die if you're mine all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Aww, baby, love never felt so good (so good)
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me,

And the nights that feels good (feels good)
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, 'cause

Baby, every time I love you it's in and out my life, in out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me it's in and out my life driving me crazy
'Cause, baby, love never felt so good
