Monday the start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away ooh

Tuesday I saw here down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me

Wednesday I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday my luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name
I never thought that this could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade

I wish Friday could last forever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there

Saturday just twenty four hours
Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday
Ooh so sad alone
