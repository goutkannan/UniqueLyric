Take me to the room where the red's all red
Take me out of my head-'s what I said
Take me to the room where the green's all green
And from what I've seen it's hot, it's mean

Take me to the room where the beat's all round
Gonna eat that sound -(yeah yeah yeah)
Take me to the room where the blacks all white
And the white's are black, take me back to the shack

Low Down-She don't take no prisoners
Go Down-Gonna give me the business
No time-Yeah chained to the rack!
Show time-Got a Dragon on my back
Show down-Go find another customer
Slow down-I gotta make my way
