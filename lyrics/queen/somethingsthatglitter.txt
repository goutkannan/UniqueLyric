Once I loved a butterfly
Don't wonder how, don't ask me why
But I believed what I'd been told
'All things that glitter can't be gold'

Ooooo ooo yeah
All things that glitter can't be gold

Those jealous minds conspired to say
Just let that creature fly away
How can it be she has it all
Her pride is headed for a fall

Ooooo ooo yeah
All things that glitter can't be gold

Oh Lord, what races we run
Seeking our place in the Sun
Reaching and doping we'll find the right one

Now every day a new joy brings
My butterfly grew golden wings
It seems we find as we grow old
Some things that glitter may be gold

Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold 

So let us mind what's there to see
Before our hearts become too cold
In spite of all that we've been told
Some things that glitter may be gold

Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold

Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter

May be gold
