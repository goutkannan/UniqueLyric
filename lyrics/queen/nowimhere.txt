Here I stand
Look around around around
But you won't see me

Now I'm here, Now I'm there, I'm just a...

Just a new man
Yes you made me live again

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be - don't worry baby I'm safe and sound

Down in the dungeon just Peaches 'n' me
Don't I love her so

A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With a rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me
Don't I love him so

Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around around around
We'll be down in the city justa you 'n' me
Don't I love you so
