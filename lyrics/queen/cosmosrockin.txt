What planet is this, mmmh? 
Let there be rock'n'roll 

It's a Saturday night and I'm home alone 
With the music on quiet I'm flying solo 
Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat 
Put the music up loud hear it in the street 
Then the neighbours start banging on my front door 
Throw the door wide open saying what's your point 
Come on in let's rock this joint 

We got the whole house rocking 
We got the whole house rocking 
We got the whole house rocking 
We got the whole house rocking 
We got the whole house rocking 
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll 

We dance out of the door, dance into the street 
And all the people are swaying to the musical beat 
We rock down the road and down to the town 
And all the people stare and smile and get down 
Then the police man is saying "stop this noise"
But the beat takes over now he's one of the boys 
The beat's taken over now he's one of the boys 

Come on down let's rock this town 

We got the whole town rocking 
We got the whole town rocking 
We got the whole town rocking 
We got the whole town rocking 
We got the whole town rocking 
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll 

Let's go 
Let it roll 
Are you ready? 
Said are you ready? 
The Cosmos Rocks 

Across seven seas through the Panama, 
Now they're rockin' on beaches and they're rockin' in bars 
Don't ask me how and don't ask me why 
From Miami Beach down to old Bondi 
There's a rock 'n' roll fever in every place 
Next thing you know they'll be rockin' out in space 

Come on down let's rock this place 
Come on down and 
Sock it to me 

We got the whole world rocking 
We got the whole world rocking 
We got the whole world rocking 
We got the whole world rocking 
We got the whole world rocking 
To the mighty mighty mighty power 

We got the cosmos rocking 
We got the cosmos rocking 
We got the universe rocking 
We got the cosmos rocking 
We got the cosmos rocking 
To the might power of rock 'n' roll
