My baby
Baby does
My baby does, me good
My baby does
May baby does me
My baby does me good

My lady
Understands
Understands me, right

She understands me
She understands me
Understands me right
My baby cares
She really cares
She knows what's really right for me
Does me good then she hurts me so
She winds me up then lets me go
Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat

My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby cuffs me
One day she tells me that she cares
Another day she tells me she don't love me
She really really does me
