When people talk of love
I'll lead the conversation
I'll say I feel just fine
Happy with my situation

But when I look away, huh
People know my mind straying
To where I once belonged
Dreaming about your heart again
(Your heart again, your heart again)
Let me in your heart again

We like to face the blues
I give you satisfaction (It's your heart again)
Despair was on your mind
I gave you the right direction (It's your heart again)

So don't you walk away
Remember it's my heart your breaking
You forget we were in love
Now my heart is only filled with pain
(Your heart again, your heart again)
Let me in your heart again

Oh my love I want you to stay
Don't leave me now or I'll just fade away
Oh my love, don't hurt me this way
Don't make me wait too long or I'll lose my mind

When people talk of love
I have no hesitation (It's your heart again)
Tell me what you're dreaming of
I'll hold a conversation for you babe (It's your heart again)

But when I look away, huh
People know my mind straying
To where I once belonged
Just let me in your heart again
Your heart again
Oh, let me in your heart again

Open the doors for me, babe

Your heart again

Let me in
Hey, love
Let me love
let me live and love in your heart again
