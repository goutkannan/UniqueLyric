Hey little babe you're changing
Babe, are you feeling sore?
Ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more

It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way

Sail Away Sweet Sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
Who loves you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
Always be in love with you

Forgive me for what I told you
My heart makes a fool of me
You know I'll never hold you
I know that you gotta be free

Sail Away Sweet Sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
Who loves you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down my friend
Sail away sweet sister
Back to my arms again

Hot child don't you know, you're young -
You've got your whole life ahead of you
Oohah - You can throw it away too soon
Way too soon
