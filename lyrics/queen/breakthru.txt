When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru . . . Now!

I wake up
Feel just fine,
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cos you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me,
I'm under your thumb, under you're spell, can't you see,
If I could only reach you,
If I could make you smile,
If I could only reach you,
That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah.

Breakthru, these barriers of pain,
Breakthru, to the sunshine from the rain,
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow,
I have to make this final breakthru.
Now!

Your smile,
Speaks books to me,
I break up,
With each and every one of your looks at me,
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me,
Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me,
I'm outta control, I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile,
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Breakthru, breakthru
