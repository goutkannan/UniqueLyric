That's the way I am
Does anybody want to know?
This is the way I lead my life, you know
Wheelin' and dealin' and a little bit of stealin'
You know, that's the way I grew up
It's the only life I know
That's the way my mother told me
And they go
Stealin'
I gave you the key to my home
I left you alone
In charge of my heart
Hey, stealin'
You got me wheelin' and dealin'
Playin' with my feelin'
Right from the start

Can't afford to pay my rent
I had to use my common sense
To get some money I owe, uh oh
This guy said look in my head
Make some easy bread
Stealin' is the only way that I know oh
Stealin' hey
Only way that I know
Yeah that I'm stealin' baby stealin'
I gave you board and my own and my own
Left you alone
Now you're stealin' stealin' stealin'
Of my heart
You're my baby's heart
Uh huh eeeee

Baby let it bleed
You're in charge of my heart

You are in charge of my heart
You are in charge of
You are in charge
Ba la ba la dap
Ba la da da da dap
Ba da da da da
Because you are in charge of my heart
I gave you the key
And told of the man
I gave you the key
Looked down on what I said
What have I done?
What have I done?
Yes I have got to bleed
On, on and on
Got to bleed on
On and on
Yes got my heart
Ha ha uh uh uh uh
