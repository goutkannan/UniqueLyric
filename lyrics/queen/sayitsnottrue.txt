The harder we play 
The faster we fall 
When we think that we know it all 
We know nothing at all 

The letter arrives 
Like a bolt from the blue 
So what's left of your lives 
All your dreams lost to you 

Say it ain't true 
Say it today 
When I open my eyes 
Will it all go away 

Say it's not true 
Say it's not real 
Can't be happening to you 
Can't be happening to me 

It's hard not to cry 
It's hard to believe 
So much heartache and pain 
So much reason to grieve 

With the wonders of science 
All the knowledge we've stored 
Magic cocktails for lives 
People just can't afford 

Say it's not true 
You can say it's not right 
It's hard to believe 
The size of the crime 

Say it's not true 
You can say it's not right 
So hard to believe 
The size of the crime 

Say... 
Say it's not real 
It could be happening to you 

Say it's not true 
Say it's not right 
It's hard to believe 
The size of the crime 

Say it's not true 
Say it's not real 
It could be happening to you 
It could be happening to me
