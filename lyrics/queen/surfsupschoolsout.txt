Surf's up
School's out
I got a criminal urge to
Twist and shout

I've been searching
My whole life through
For some perfect dream
Imagined in my youth

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out

For a perfect life
Find a perfect girl
You gotta follow that dream
To a perfect world

I've been a searcher
An adventurer too
This ride still runs
I wanna ride with you

This ride still runs
Wanna ride with you

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out

In the town and the country
We all lay and dreamed our dreams
Then we found the world is tough
And all is not quite what it seems
Gotta take it by the horns
Gotta seize your precious day
Got to follow your dream

Follow that dream
Follow that dream

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out

Follow that dream
Follow that dream
