Don't you misfire
Fill me up
With the desire
To carry on

Don't you know honey, that love's a game
It's always hit or miss, so take your aim
Got to hold on tight, shoot me out of sight

Don't you misfire...
Don't you misfire...

Your gun is loaded, and pointing my way
There's only one bullet, so don't delay
Got to time it right, fire me through the night

Come on, take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire, misfire
