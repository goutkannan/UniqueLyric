Ok
Don't do it Don't you try it baby
Don't do that Don't Don't Don't
Don't do that
You got a good thing going now
Don't do it Don't do it
Don't

Don't try suicide
Nobody's worth it
Don't try suicide
Nobody cares
Don't try suicide
Just gonna hate it
Don't try suicide
Nobody gives a damn

So you think it's the easy way out
Think you're gonna slash your wrists
This time
Baby when you do it all you do is
Get on my tits
Don't do that try try try baby
Don't do that - you got a good thing going now
Don't do it Don't do it - Don't

[Chorus:]
You need help
Look at yourself you need help
You need life
So don't hang yourself
It's o.k. o.k. o.k. o.k.
You just can't be a prick teaser all of the time
A little bit attention - you got it
Need some affection - you got it
Suicide suicide suicide bid
Suicide suicide sucide bid
Suicide

Don't do it Don't do it Don't do it babe
Don't do it Don't do it Don't-do it
Don't put your neck on the line
Don't drown on me babe
Blow your brains out -
Don't do that - yeah

[Chorus:]
Nobody gives - nobody gives
Nobody gives a damn
