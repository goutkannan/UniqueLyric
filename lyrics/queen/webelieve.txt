I believe there's no evil out there we didn't have a hand in 
You believe it's a time for peace and a time for understanding 
Some of us believe that we are chosen 
And if God is on our side we'll win the game 
And some of us believe that there's a heaven 
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name 
But let's get it straight: 

I believe there's just once chance in this world to hear our brothers 
You believe there's a better way to listen to each other 
We don't get what the other guy is saying 
We hear the words but we don't understand 
So around the world the same old anger raging 
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down 

We believe there's a better way to fight 
There's a way to make our children safe at night 
We believe there's a war we could be winning 
But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive 

I believe we need a hero to step boldly from the shadows 
You believe there must be someone on the scene that fits the bill 
A man or a woman who knows how to say I'm sorry 
With courage in his heart to match his creed 
A leader who can build a brand new morning 
And match the tide of changes 
Match the intent with the deed 

We believe there's a deed of obligation 
To bring reconciliation 
To make peace with every nation - in our time 
We believe there's not a minute we should be wasting 
When the darkness falls it's too late to fix the crime 
It's peace that we need 

Every father every mother knows the meaning 
Human treasure that our leaders do forget 
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason 
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get 

We believe there's a song that's worth the singing 
It's a song of truth we're bringing 
There's a way to share the Earth with everyone 
We believe every creature has a being 
Has a right to respect and feeling 
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun 

That's what we believe
