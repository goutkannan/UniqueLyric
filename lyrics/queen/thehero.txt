So you feel that you ain't nobody
Always needed to be somebody
Put your feet on the ground
Put your hand on your heart
Lift your head to the stars
And the world's for your taking

(All you gotta do is save the world)

So you feel it's the end of the story
Find it all pretty satisfactory
Well I tell you my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation
Is yours for the making

Yes you're a hero (oooh yeah)

[Instrumental]

Flash!! Ahaaa

He's for every one of us
Stands for every one of us
He saved with a mighty hand (with a mighty hand)
Every man every woman 
Every child he's the mighty

Flash! Ahahhhhhh
