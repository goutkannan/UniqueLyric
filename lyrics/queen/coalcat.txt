You're taking all the sunshine away
Making out like you're the mainline - I knew that
Cos you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Just cruising - driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart
You're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit-chat
You're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Messing with the beat of my heart
You used to be a mean kid
Making such a deal of life
You were wishing and hoping wand waiting to
really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen, no
You're speeding too fast
Slow down Slow down
You'd better slow down
Slow down
You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove
Cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Just cuising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart - yeah yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
