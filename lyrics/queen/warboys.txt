They were raised, learning only ways to stay alive 
Their language is the language of the bullet and the gun 
If you can see them coming, baby better run 

Here come the warboys 
Here come the warboys 

Well they look so pretty as they march and drill 
It's such, a pity that they're dressed to kill 
Soldiers marching two by two

Here come the... war 

Warboys, warboys, children and their toys 
Warboys, warboys, make lot a noise 
Warboys, when the lightning exlpodes

Hup...2...3...4 

Well they look so fierce they're gonna tear out your heart 
When they get near we're gonna see what they got

I'll see you in hell, some other time

Helping to kill, those who deserve to die 
Tell me who decides 
You and I 
We have the power
