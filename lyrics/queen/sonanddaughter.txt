Tried to be your son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun
Now didn't you feel surprise to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit

What'll you do for loving
When its only just begun?
I want you to be a woman

Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal
Will you lead us all the same?
Well I travelled around the world
To find a brand new word for day
Watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
What'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?
I want you to be a woman
