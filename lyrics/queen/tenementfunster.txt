My new purple shoes, bin' amazin' the people next door
And my rock 'n roll 45's, bin' enragin' the folks on the lower floor

I got a way with girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kinda ritual

Oh give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or, just give me an open car, I'll make the speed of light outta this place

I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation, just cuts like a knife
When you're young, and you're poor, and you're crazy

But oh, give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or, just give me an open car, I'll make the speed of light outta this place
