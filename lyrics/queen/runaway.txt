As I walk along I wonder 
What went wrong with our love 
A love that was so strong 
And as I still walk on I think of 
The things we've done together 
While our hearts were young 

I'm a-walking in the rain 
Tears are falling and I feel the pain 
Wishing you were here by me 
To end this misery and I wonder 
I wah, wah, wah, wah wonder 
Why 
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away 
And I wonder when she will stay 
My little runaway a-run, run, run, run, a-runaway 

I'm a-walking in the rain 
Tears are falling and I feel the pain 
Wishing you were here by me 
To end this misery and I wonder 
I wah, wah, wah, wah wonder 
Why 
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away 
And I wonder when she will stay 
My little runaway, a-run, run, run, run, a-runaway 
Run run run run runaway 
Run run run run runaway
