Calling all people on streets
Around the world

Some sleepless nights in wait for you
Some foreign presence you feel, comes

Some stream of hope
The whole world through
Spread like some silent disease
You'll get yours too

Love
Take a message of love
Far and near
Take a message of love
For all to hear
For all to hear
Calling all girls
