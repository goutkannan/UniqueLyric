Are you ready? - well are you ready?
Give me your mind baby give me your body
Give me some time baby let's have a party
It ain't no time for sleepin' baby

Soon it's round your street I'm creeping

We gonna Tear it up
Stir it up
Break it up - Baby -

You gotta Tear it up
Shake it up
Make it up - as you go along.

Tear it up
Square it up
Wake it up - Baby.

Tear it up
Stir it up
Stake it out - and you can't go wrong.
(Hey)
I love you cos you're sweet and I love you cos you're naughty
I love you for you mind but give me your body
I wanna be a toy at your birthday party
Wind me up - wind me up - wind me up - let me go -

Tear it up
Stir it up
Break it up - let me go.

Tear it up
Shake it up
Make it up - as you go along.

Tear it up
Turn it up
Burn it up.

Baby baby baby are you ready for me? (Oh yeah)
Baby baby baby are you ready for love? (Oh yeah)
Are you ready - are you ready - are you ready for me? (Oh yeah)
I love you so near, I love you so far
I gotta tell you baby you're driving me Ga Ga.
