I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no
Neptune of the seas
Have you an answer for me please
And the lily of the valley doesn't know

I lie in wait with open eyes
I carry on through stormy skies
I follow every course
My kingdom for a horse
But each time I grow old
Serpent of the Nile
Relieve me for a while
And cast me from your spell and let me go

Messenger from Seven Seas has flown
To tell the King of Rhye he's lost his throne
Wars will never cease
Is there time enough for peace
But the lily of the valley doesn't know
