I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man,
Incredible how you can,
See right through me,

When you hear a sound,
That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move
That you just can't trace,
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread.

I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you.

Now I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like the CIA
Or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you,

Hah, hah, hah, hello,
Hah, hah, hah, hello,
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello-hello-hello,
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or a girl
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl
So make my mark from the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world,

Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind,
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
Put I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me dear,

I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
Look at me, look at me
