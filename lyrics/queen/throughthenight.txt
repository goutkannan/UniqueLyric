Tell me something that'll ease my pain
I am living life in vain
Crying doesn't help me any more
Tell me something that'll ease my mind
I am walking the line
Trying doesn't get my anywhere

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night

Tell me something 'cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
I can't face it and there's no place I can hide

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night

Tell me something 'cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
Without your love there's nowhere I can hide

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Earching for a guding light
I wander through the night
