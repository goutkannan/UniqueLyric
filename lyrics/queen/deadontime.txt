Fool always jumping never happy where you land
Fool got my bus'ness make your living where you can
Hurry down the highway
Hurry down the road
Hurry past the people staring
Hurry hurry hurry hurry

Leave on time leave on time
Never got your ticket but you leave on time
Leave on time leave on time
Gonna get your ticket but you leave on time
Put it in your pocket but you never can tell

Leave on time leave on time
Shake that rattle gonna leave on time
Leave on time leave on time
Fight your battle but you leave on time
Leave on time leave on time
Never got a minute no you never got a minute
No you never never got on no matter

Fool got no bus'ness hanging round and telling lies
Fool you got no reasons but you got no compromise
Stamping
Gotta get out gotta get out gotta get out
Oh you know I'm going crazy

Leave on time leave on time
Gotta get ahead but you leave on time
Leave on time leave on time
Gonna head on ahead but you leave on time
Leave on time leave on time
You're running in the red but you never can tell

Leave on time leave on time
Gotta get rich gonna leave on time
Leave on time leave on time
But you can't take it with you when you leave on time
Leave on time leave on time
Got to keep yourself alive gotta leave on time
Gotta leave on time leave on time
Dead on time
'You're Dead'
