When I hear that rock and roll,
It gets down to my soul,
When it's real rock and roll, oh rock and roll.

Oh Oh, Oh Oh,
You really think they like to rock in space?
Well I don't know

What do you know?
What do you hear?
On the radio
I said Mama
I ain't crazy
I'm alright - alright
Hey, c'mon baby said it's alright
To rock and roll on a Saturday night
I said shoot and get your suit and come along with me
I said c'mon baby down come and rock and roll with me, I said yeah.

What do you do?
To get to feel alive?
You go downtown
And get some of that prime jive,
I said Mama etc.
We're gonna rock it............ tonight.
(We want some prime jive)
(We want some prime jive)
We're gonna rock it tonight
C'mon honey
Get some of that prime jive
Get some of that, get, get down
C'mon honey - we're gonna rock it tonight.
