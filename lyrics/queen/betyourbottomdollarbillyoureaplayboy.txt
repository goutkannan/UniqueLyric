Daddy Cool with a ninety dollar smile
Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right outta town - well

I gotta getty up, steady up, shoot him down
Gotta hit that latitude - babe

Daddy Cool with a ninety dollar smile
Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right outta town - well

Big bad Leroy Brown he got no common
sense - no, no
He got no brains but he sure gotta lot of style
Can't stand no more in this here jail
I gotta rid myself of this sentence

Gotta get out the heat, step into the shade
Gotta get me there dead or alive - babe

Wooh, wooh, big bad Leroy, wooh, wooh,
Wooh, wooh, big bad Leroy - Brown - well

Daddy Cool with a ninety dollar smile
Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right outta town - well

Big Mama Lulu Belle she had a nervous breakdown
(She had a nervous breakdown)
Leroy's taken her honey chile away
But she met him down at the station
Put a shot gun to his head
And unless I be mistaken
This is what she said
"Big bad, big boy, big bad Leroy Brown
I'm gonna get that cutie pie"

Daddy Cool with a ninety dollar smile
Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right outta town - well
