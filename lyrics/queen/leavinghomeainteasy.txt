I take a step outside
And I breathe the air
And I slam the door
And I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame
I won't call you names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games

I'm all through with ties
I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man
Don't it look that way?
Shaking dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way back home
Ohh but I have
Leaving home ain't easy
Oh I never thought it would be easy
Leaving on your own
Oh is the main thing calling me back?
Leaving home ain't easy
On the one your leaving home

Stay my love my love please stay
Stray my love what's wrong my love?
What's right my love?
Ohh leaving home ain't easy
I thought how could I think of leaving
Leaving on your own
Still trying to persuade me that
Leaving home ain't necessary
Leave the only way
Leaving home ain't easy
But may be the only way
