When the moons rises
The dogs will howl
Look out of your window
I'll be on the prowl
I'm not usually
A gambling man
But oh I just wanna
Hold up my hands

And say I'm
Taking a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking a chance on you love

I'm not superstitious
And I don't wear no charm
I don't carry my heart on the sleeve of my arm
Seven years of bad luck
Please don't worry me
'Cause when I look in the mirror
Here's the future I see

I'm taking a chance on you love
Woah, I'm taking a chance on you love

Place your bets, Better yet
Don't forget, What I said
Roll the dice, Spin the wheel
Always remember, You've got to keep it real

Don't believe in voodoo
Black magic was never my style
But I believe you do
And it won't take much time
To gather the portions
That weave your magic spell
The moon on the ocean
Has a secret to tell

But anyway I'm
Taking a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking a chance on you love
