With the sun in your eyes and the wind in your face
To heaven you rise in a holy embrace
Your feet on the round your head in the clouds
And you're wondering if you're never coming down

In an istant the mysteries of life will unfold
The myths and the dragons of time will explode
Here's to a real understanding of truth
For compassion and grace to be given their chance too

Raise up your mind
It's time to shine

A moment down through millennium
Unveiling the secrets of song to be sung
Waters of life flowing soft to the touch
Wisdom remembered have we forgotten oh so much

Raise up your mind
It's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine

Let's awaken from barbarity
Into a world of serenity
Beyond the rage of foolish pride
And on to the golden shores of paradise

Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Your time to shine
It's time to shine
It's time to shine:
