In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on

[First voice] [Second Voice]
My fairy king can see things | He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me | Ohh yeah he guides the winds

My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong
Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry no salt from sand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for the poor man's eyes

Someone someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother mercury (mercury)
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run I cannot hide
