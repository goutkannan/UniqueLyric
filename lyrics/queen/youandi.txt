Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering
My heart's jittering
Just you and I

Not tonight
Come tomorrow
When everything's sunny and bright
No No No
Come tomorrow
Cos then we'll be waiting for the moonlight

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight

Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay a while

You know I never could foresee the future years
You know I never could see
where life was leading me
But will we be together for ever
What will be my love, can't you see that I just don't know

No no not tonight
Come tomorrow
When everything's gonna be alright
Wait and see
If tomorrow
We'll be as happy as we're feeling tonight

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight

I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where to lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
Just you and I
Just you and I
