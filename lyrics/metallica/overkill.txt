Only way to feel the noise
Is when it's good and loud
So good I can't believe it
Screamin' with the crowd

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
Shut up

On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head, you must be dead
If it don't make you fly

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
Get the fuck down

Ooh yeah

Know your body's made to move
It goes straight to your spine
You gotta move it
If it don't make you fly

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
Get on it!
