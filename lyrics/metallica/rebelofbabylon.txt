Rebel grip your bottle tight
Just float away
Rebel is it hard to leave
What makes you stay?
Go take your poison ink
Sign life away
Then take your dirty spoon
And dig your grave

Rebel grips the bottle tight
Just floats away
Rebel finds it hard to leave
What makes you stay?
He takes the poison ink
Signing life away
Then takes the dirty spoon
And digs his grave

Let this dark shine
Let this dark shine
Let it shine bright
Don't let it burn out tonight
Kill me one more time
Stigmata
Kill me one more time
Neo martyr
Gonna die young
Gonna live forever
Kill me one more time
Rise up
Rebel of Babylon
Rise up
Rise up
Resurrection

Renegade fights the fight
That no one wins
He claims a crown of thorns
To pierce the skin
He climbs his crucifix
And waits for dawn
Thinks they'll remember him
After he's gone

The rebel fights the fight
That no one wins
To claim a crown of thorns
To pierce his skin
Climbs his crucifix
And waits for dawn
He loses consciousness
The myth lives on
