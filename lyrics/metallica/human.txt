Don't you leave me Father Time
Take me with you
Tell me does your sun still shine
Come squeeze the world and drip it down my throat...oh yeah
Down my throat again....woooah

You got to breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
Breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for Air

Touch me so I think I'm here
Skin my senses
Barely breathing
Minus Human
Please squeeze the world and drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again.....woooah

You got to breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
Breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for Air

You got to breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
Breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for!
