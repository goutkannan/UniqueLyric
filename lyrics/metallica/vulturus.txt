Woah yeah
Woah oh
Woah oh
Woah oh

The vultures come
See the vultures come for me
Fly around the sun
But now too late for me
Just sit and stare
Wait 'til I hit the ground
Little vultures tear
Little vultures tear at flesh

[Chorus:]
Vulture is down to stay
Pick the bone until you're clean
Bone to bone and in between
Pick the bone until you're clean

Woah oh
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah oh
Woah oh woah

[Solo]

Right without soul
I rummage high and low
Search for my soul
Search though I'm high above
We leave behind
Too late, too late again
I just want to search the soul
But my soul is flesh and bone again

[Chorus]

Woah oh
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah woah
Woah oh woah

Vulturus
Search on Vulturus
Vulturus

[Solo]

Vulturus
Search on Vulturus
Vulturus
Search on

Woah yeah
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah oh

[Chorus]

Woah oh yeah
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah oh yeah
Woah oh woah!

Vulturus!
