Hey babe don't act so scared
All I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation

And I can tell by his face
I'm a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case

Hey baby wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I Ain't lookin' to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you

I can tell by your face
I'm all over this place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case

No time baby!

Hey babe don't turn away
I'm here tomorrow, gone today
I don't know what you think your game is
I don't care if you want your name is

And I can tell by this face
You're all over the place
I can tell by his face
Move over for a damage case
Get the fuck over man!

All right
