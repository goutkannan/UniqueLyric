Hey Hey Hey
Here I go now
Here I go into new days
Hey Hey Hey
Here I go now
Here I go into new days

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah Hey Hey Hey Yeah Yeah
Here I go into new days

Hey Hey Hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Hey Hey Hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah Yeah Hey, Hey no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

Do you bury me when I'm gone
Do you teach me while I'm here
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Hey Hey Hey
And I went
And I went on down that road
Hey Hey Hey
And I went on
And I went on down that road

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Hey Hey Hey Yeah, And I went on
And I went on down that road

Do you bury me when I'm gone
Do you teach me while I'm here
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Do you bury me when I'm gone
Do you teach me while I'm here
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Do you bury me when I'm gone
Do you teach me while I'm here
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Do you bury me when I'm gone
Do you teach me while I'm here
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
