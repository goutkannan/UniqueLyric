Get on!

You think you see me
In the glass
You think you hear me
Better listen fast
I think I see you
Gone to seed
Think your reason
Is your guilt and greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
All right

You're a financial wizard
Yeah a top tycoon
You're Sweet long lizard
With a silver spoon
You know you've never had it
Quite so good
And you didn't know
That you even could

Your time has come to own
Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
All right

Financial wizard
A top tycoon
Sweet lounge lizard
With a silver spoon
You've never had it
Quite so good
And you didn't know
That you even could

But your time has turned to gold
Your touch is turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever

It's been a long time
It's been a long long wait
And you caught your fingers
In the pearly gates
You better leave your number
And we'll call you
You know your problem
Ain't exactly new

Your time has come today
Your face has turned to hey
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
That's right

Yo

Ah
