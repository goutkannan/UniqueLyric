[A Light In The Black intro]

[Tarot Woman]

I don't wanna go
Something tells me no, no, no, no
But traces in the sand
The lines inside my hand say go go go

Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know

Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

She can take you there
The entrance to the fair, my, my, my
Ride the carousel
Cast a magic spell, you can fly, fly, fly

Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know

Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

[Stargazer]

High noon
Oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years' worth
Of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides
Why he's lighter than air
Oh I see his face

Where is your star
Is it far, is it far, is it far
When do we leave
I believe, I believe, yes, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
So many die

We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
Don't know why

Now where do we go...

[Kill The King]

Danger, danger the Queen's about to kill
There's a stranger, stranger and life about to spill
Oh no move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the king
Tear him down
Kill the king, yeah
Strike him down

Power, power happens every day
Power, devour all along the way
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
And fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the king
Strike him down

Treason, treason, the spectre looms again
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the rainbow
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the king, yeah
Tear him down
Kill the king, yeah
Got to take his crown
