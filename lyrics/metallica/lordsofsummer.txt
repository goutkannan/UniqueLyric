Sight
Pale riders into the night
Galloping harder and faster

Through your dreaming wake
Walk through the fire innate
Frost bitten soul below zero

Excitation
Are you remembering the sound
Recall the shaking of the ground

Calling, calling
All as one
Lords of summer bring the sun

Coming, coming
Winter's yearn
Lords of summer shall return

Eternal thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
For soon the lords of summer shall return

Lords of summer shall return

Straight
Life passes through penetrate
It's been a long lonely winter

Illumination
Bright
Fading the volume and light
Reanimated by fire

Transformation
Become the nexus of the sound
Become the shaking of the ground

Calling, calling
All as one
Lords of summer bring the sun

Coming, coming
Winter's yearn
Lords of summer have returned

Eternal thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
Now that the lords of summer have returned

Lords of summer have returned

Calling, calling
All as one
Lords of summer bring the sun

Coming, coming
Winter's yearn
Lords of summer have returned, have returned

Eternal thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
Now that the lords of summer have returned

Lords of summer have returned
