Motives changing, day to day,
The fire increases, masks decay.
I look at the river, white foam floats down,
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

After wakening, silence grows,
The screams subside, distortion shows.
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Is just another birth of distorted views.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.
