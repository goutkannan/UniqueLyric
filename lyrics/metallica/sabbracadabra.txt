I feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady, always on my mind
She gives me love every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never going away

Someone to love me, you know she makes me feel alright!
Someone to need me, love me every single day!

I feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love it's something out of this world
It feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, I'll love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime
I lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child never was conceived
You gotta believe me!
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!
Well, I know it hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
When it's time to die
I don't believe the knife you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, Ha Ha!!

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love, it's something out of this world
Feel so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know she's all mine,
She's all mine, yeah!
