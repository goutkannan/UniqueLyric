Hate is a train
That thunders aimless through my head
And hate is the fame
Chained to the wheel until I am dead
Rage is a flame
Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry I shall be
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge

No
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand

Wrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame 
And holds me down until it is through
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge

You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I sink into the sorrow, still I stand

And hate is a train
That hungers for the flesh's call
And hate takes the blame
A beast that never slows at all
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake the gates of hell again

Yeah, cursed to drown in sorrow

You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
You left me here with sorrow, still I stand

Oh, still I stand
