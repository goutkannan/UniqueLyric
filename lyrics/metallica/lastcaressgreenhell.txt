I've got something to say, I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead.
I've got something to say, I raped your mother today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as she's spread.

Sweet Lovely Death
Just waiting for your breath
Come sweet Death One Last Caress.

I've got something to say, I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead.
I've got something to say, I raped your mother today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as she's spread.

Sweet Lovely Death
Just waiting for your breath
Come sweet Death One Last Caress.

Sweet Lovely Death
Just waiting for your breath
Come sweet Death One Last Caress.

One Last Caress today,
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh [repeat]

Here in this place lies the key to your death,
Touch it, see it.
Here in this place is the means to your end,
Touch it, feel it, green hell.

You did your best as someone could,
I bet you never knew you would,
And did you run away from me,
I bet you thought you really could.

We're gonna burn in hell - Green hell.
Like every hell but kind of green - Green hell, green hell.
Try let me get back up there - Green hell, green hell.
Feel it burning in your cereal - Green hell, green hell.
Throw your fuckin' friends inside - Green hell, green hell.
Gotta fuckin' pay and you must stay - Green hell.
Cannot refill the torch of death - Green hell, green hell.
Hell is reigning in your blood - Green hell, green hell.
Gotta burn it all, green hell.

You did your best as someone could,
I bet you never knew you would,
And did you run away from me,
I bet you thought you really could.

Here in this place lies the key to your death,
Touch it, see it.
Here in this place is your world that ended,
Touch it, feel it, green hell.

You did your best as someone could,
I bet you never knew you would,
And did you run away from me,
I bet you thought you really could.
You've come to this as someone told,
I bet you never knew you would.
Gonna bring green hell, green hell.
