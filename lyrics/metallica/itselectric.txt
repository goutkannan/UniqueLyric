I'm gonna be a rock and roll star
Gotta groove from night to day
Gotta blow my crummy job
Gonna blow my blues away
I'm gonna make a stand
Gonna make a million
Gonna make it with you
I'm gonna be wild my friend
I gotta push it through

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric

I stop on red and I leave on amber
Danger paves my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna kick this dust from my heels
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric

I stop on red and I leave on amber
Danger paves my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna kick this dust from my heels
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
